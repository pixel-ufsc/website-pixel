This repository contains the source code of the Pixel website, which can be accessed at [ejpixel.com.br](https://ejpixel.com.br). This website is built in [React](https://reactjs.org/) using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework. The website is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and the content management backend and frontend in built and hosted on [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) allowing the content to be edited by non-technical users through an easy to use web interface - without the need to change the code.

## Technical information

The choice of the Next.js framework allowed for Server Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) to be used, which improves the website's SEO and performance as SEO plays an important roll for institutional websites such and this one. The website is hosted on Netlify, which allows for the website to be built and deployed automatically whenever a change is made to the code.

The content management system's (CMS) interface can be accessed through [this link](https://ejpixel.sanity.studio). Note that this will require a login, which can be provided by the website's administrator account.
